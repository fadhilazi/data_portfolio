# 🔗 Simple ETL Python | Kaggle API to SQL Server

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **ETL pipeline built with Python** in VS Code. The purpose of this project is to understand what is an ETL and how to create a simple ETL pipeline from a data source into SQL Server for further use. This project showcases the development of an ETL pipeline designed to automate the lifecycle of data from ingestion to storage.

## What is ETL?
**ETL** stands for **Extract, Transform, and Load.** A foundational process in Data Engineering to move various data from various sources to a data warehouse or database.
- **Extract**: The process of retrieving raw data from a data source;
- **Transform**: The step where data is cleaned and formatted to ensure the data is "query ready";
- **Load**: The final step where the processed data is written into the target destination, such as a table in SQL Server.

This project demonstrates a streamlined ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built with Python in VS Code. The pipeline automates the flow of data from a Kaggle API source directly into a SQL Server database. By using the Chocolate Sales dataset [Chocolate Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/chocolate-sales)
, this project illustrates how to bridge the gap between raw external data and a structured environment ready for analysis and business intelligence.


<br>
<br>Data source which is used in this project is from a Kaggle API which could be accessed here [Chocolate Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/chocolate-sales)


//- The process of retrieving raw data from a source—in this case, pulling a CSV file via the Kaggle API.//
